h2 Why
I found myself always struggling for for a basic set of rules to make a decent reading experience. I find this minimal boilerplate useful for bootstrapping a project with a typography created learning from the best: Medium.com.

The elements covered are:

There are three custom classes:
- .highlighted, highlights text setting background-color
